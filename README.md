# Advent of Code 2017, Go

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017), in [Go](https://golang.org/).

Not much to see here. This code isn't meant to be elegant/efficient/whatever, it's just a way for me to try out Go and have some fun.

Go is starting to grow on me by the way. I didn't like it at first, but after some time, I find that it might be the exact blend of c and python that i've been looking for.
